For this task, we'd like you to continue your work on the pizza app and create a page for our pizza shop staff.

## Project description

Now we have a working app to take orders of pizza, we need to show the orders to our staff to prepare the pizzas.

As a staff, I should be able to see a list of orders categorized by 3 statuses: pending, processing, delivered.

As a staff, I can drag and drop an order from a status to another status e.g. from pending to processing.

An ajax call will be performed to `/orders` to update order status.
